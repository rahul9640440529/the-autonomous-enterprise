# Patterns

This directory contains implementation-agnostic architectural patterns described in *The Autonomous Enterprise*.

## Purpose

Patterns in this directory document **recurring design structures** for governed autonomous systems. They describe architectural shapes and control flow relationships—not code, configuration, or deployment procedures.

These patterns support:

- Architecture reviews where teams evaluate design options
- Security assessments where reviewers need to understand control boundaries
- Technical leadership conversations about system structure

## Constraints

All patterns in this directory must:

- Remain implementation-agnostic and technology-neutral
- Reference concepts defined in the book
- Avoid prescribing specific frameworks, vendors, or tooling

See [`BOOK_CONTEXT.md`](../BOOK_CONTEXT.md) for full repository constraints.
